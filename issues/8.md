## Set up testing and linting framework

The project currently has no automated tests or linting. Adding a lightweight testing framework (Vitest or Jest) and ESLint/Prettier will:

1. Catch regressions early.
2. Enforce a consistent style.
3. Provide a foundation for the CI workflow.

Suggested steps:
- Add a `package.json` with scripts for `test`, `lint`, and `format`.
- Install `vitest`, `eslint`, `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged` as dev‑dependencies.
- Create minimal config files (`.eslintrc.cjs`, `.prettierrc`, `vitest.config.js`).
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs tests on push/Pull‑request.
- Use `husky` + `lint-staged` to lint/format on commit.

A sample test file for the card‑counting logic is provided below.
